# Timeline of skills
I will use this section to create a diary of my skills as a personal reflection of how far I have come on my coding journey but also as a record of my current level and consistency over time.

## 10/08/2021 - LazyPredict
Started using the LazyPredict package to more easily run many classification and regression models on a data set in one method. The resulting table can then inform me of the best potential models going forward which I can more finely tune.

## 09/08/2021 - Icecream
Started using the Icecream package to create better print statements for debugging. I like Icecream as it allows me to leave the print statements in, but to disable them easily when the script is ready for production.
